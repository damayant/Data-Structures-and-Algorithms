# Data Structures and Algorithm
* Linked List
```
1.  Remove  Kth Node
2.  Reverse Linked List 
3.  Count nodes in a Linked List
4.  Check if there is a loop (in O(n) space)
5.  Merge two sorted linked lists
```

* Binary Search Tree
```
1.  BST Traversal - inorder, preorder, postorder
2.  Height calculation
3.  Check if BST is balanced
4.  Find the closest value 
5.  Sum of the branches in a BT 
```

* Dynamic Programming
```
1. Highest sum of contiguous subset
```
* Strings
```
1. Check palindromic strings
2. Check 
    a.  if two strings are anagrams
    b.  group anagrams in a list (source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGyGLIx69Og)
```

* Array
```
1. Find two numbers in the list which sum up to a given sum
2. Find the smallest difference between two numbers each belonging from two different arrays
